Instead of pitching our product, I started pitching a 'design partnership' - 3 months free in exchange for their input on the roadmap and a case study. I also stopped selling to the end-user and started mapping the buying committee first. Found the internal champion, then asked THEM who else needed to approve. Let them sell internally while I armed them with materials. The key was reducing their risk to near-zero while making them look good internally.",
